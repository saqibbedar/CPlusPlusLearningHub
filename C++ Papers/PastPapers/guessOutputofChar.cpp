int main(){

    int i1 = 0;
    char ch1 = 'X', ch2 = 'y';

    cin >> i1; // new value would be assigned to the i1 as per question 453 z721

    cin.get(ch1);
    cin>> ch2 >> i1;
}

/* 

Explanation: 

int i1 = 0; declares an integer variable i1 and initializes it to 0.

char ch1 = 'X', ch2 = 'y'; declares two character variables, ch1 initialized to 'X', and ch2 initialized to 'y'.

cout << "Enter a number: "; displays the prompt to the user to enter a number.

Now, let's consider the input: "453 z721" entered after the prompt. Here's what happens:

cin >> i1;: The input "453" is read, and i1 is assigned the value 453.

cin.get(ch1);: cin.get() reads the next character, which is a space (' '), and assigns it to ch1. So, ch1 will be ' ' (a space).

cin >> ch2 >> i1;: This attempts to read characters and numbers in sequence. It reads "z721" from the input. Since it starts with a character ('z'), it assigns 'z' to ch2 and then reads the number "721" and assigns it to i1. Therefore, ch2 will be 'z', and i1 will be 721.

So, after the execution of the code with the given input, the values of the variables will be:

ch1 = ' ' (a space)
ch2 = 'z'
i1 = 721
