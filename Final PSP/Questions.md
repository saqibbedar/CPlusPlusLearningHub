   - Implement a function that takes a string and a function pointer to transform the string (e.g., convert to uppercase).

**Memory Allocation and Strings:**

    - Write a program to dynamically allocate memory for a string and copy another string into it.
    - Implement a function to concatenate two strings using dynamic memory allocation.
    - Create a program that reads a string from the user, dynamically allocates memory for it, and reverses the string.
