The `+=` operator is used in C++ for incrementing the value of a variable by a specified amount and then assigning the result back to the same variable. In other words, it's a shorthand way to update a variable by adding a given value to it.

Here's how it works:

```cpp
variable += value;
```

- `variable` is the variable you want to update.
- `value` is the amount you want to add to `variable`.

It's equivalent to writing:

```cpp
variable = variable + value;
```

Here's an example to illustrate how `+=` works:

```cpp
int x = 5;
x += 3; // This is the same as writing x = x + 3;

// Now, x will be 8 because we added 3 to its original value.
```

You can use `+=` with various data types, including integers, floats, and other numeric types. It's a convenient way to update variables, especially when you want to increment or decrement them by a specific amount.

It's worth noting that `+=` is not limited to just addition; it can be used for other arithmetic operations like subtraction, multiplication, and division as well. For example:

```cpp
int y = 10;
y -= 2; // Subtraction: y = y - 2;

int z = 4;
z *= 5; // Multiplication: z = z * 5;

float a = 6.0;
a /= 2.0; // Division: a = a / 2.0;
```
